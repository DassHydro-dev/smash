Spatial desagragation of the input raster
*****************************************

If the resolution of the input raster is diffrent of the resolution of the model mesh, the input raster are automatically reprojected by gdal. In that case the reading of the input can be slower. For best performances, it can be usful to preprocess the input files (precipitations). Some functions available in smash.core.raster could help for pre-processing.

Boundary conditions checking
****************************

The boundary condition checking previously used a tolerance of 1e-6, which caused issues in certain cases due to machine precision when passing from Python to Fortran via the f90wrapper.
To address this problem, the tolerance has been decreased to 1e-3.

See issue `#23 <https://github.com/DassHydro-dev/smash/issues/23>`__.
