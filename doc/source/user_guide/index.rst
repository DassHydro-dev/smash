Getting started with the `smash` package can be done by following all the ``Quickstart`` sections below. The different cases will call upon the major part of the available tools. In order not to overload the cases, additional and more precise information can be found in the ``In Depth`` section.  
Most of the time, references to the in depth section are made in the cases allowing to go further on specific methods by following the implementation of a distributed hydrological simulation with `smash`.
