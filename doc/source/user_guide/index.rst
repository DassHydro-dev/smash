Getting started with the `smash` package can be done by following all the ``Cases`` below. The different cases will call upon the major part of the available tools. In order not to overload the cases, additional and more precise information can be found in the ``In Depth`` section.  
Most of the time, references to the in depth section are made in the cases allowing to go further on specific methods by following the implementation of a distributed hydrological simulation with `smash`.
