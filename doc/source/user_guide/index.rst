User guide

This User Guide covers most of the functionalities of `smash` i.e. setup options, minimization details, in/out etc. Practical use of `smash` functionalities is detailled on real catchments with data and scripts provided to the user. Those scripts cover `smash` uses of increasing complexity, from simple foward run on a single catchment to advanced spatially distributed calibrations or data assimilation with multi site data. The idea is to provide users with a solid base that can be used to rapidly setup new modeling projects.
