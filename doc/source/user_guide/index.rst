User guide
==========

The practical use of `smash` is first done on a :ref:`user_guide.practice_case`, allowing new users to have a global view of the available tools, from the creation of input data, to the output of results. In a second step, a :ref:`user_guide.real_case_cance` is set up on which all the methods/applications made on the :ref:`user_guide.practice_case` are reapplied with more detailed explanations.
Finally, the in depth section allows to go into the details of the different uses of the `smash` package.
