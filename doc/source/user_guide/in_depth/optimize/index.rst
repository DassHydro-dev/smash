Model optimization
==================

This section covers advanced techniques for optimizing model parameters and initial states, 
in addition to the classical methods explained in the :ref:`Quickstart <quickstart.cance.optimization>` section.

The examples in this section use the ``Lez`` dataset, 
which contains daily data from 3 nested gauges spanning a total area of 169kmÂ².
