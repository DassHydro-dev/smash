**smash** is a Python library, that provides a variety of user-friendly routines for hydrological data preprocessing and numerical analysis, as well as powerful high-dimensional optimization tools interfacing with an efficient Fortran solver.

**smash** offers a range of advanced optimization techniques, including Variational Data Assimilation (VDA), Bayesian estimation, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches, using an adjoint model based on Automatic Differentiation Engine ([TAPENADE](https://doi.org/10.1145/2450153.2450158)).

Whether you are managing water resources or conducting research on hydrological models, **smash** can provide a user-friendly and powerful solution for your work. See [this documentation](https://smash.recover.inrae.fr/getting_started/index.html) for the installation instructions.
