**smash** is a Python library, that provides a variety of user-friendly routines for hydrological data preprocessing and numerical analysis, specifically high-dimensional optimization tools interfacing with an efficient Fortran solver.

**smash** offers a range of advanced optimization techniques, including Variational Data Assimilation (VDA), Bayesian estimation, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches, using an adjoint model based on the **Tapenade** Automatic Differentiation Engine.
